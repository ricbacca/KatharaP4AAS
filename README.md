# KatharaP4AAS

IGNITE 5.0 Project - Unibo 2024/2025.

Work in progress.

## To start up:
1. Goes to "App" folder and execute "gradle build". Verify that in folder "kathara/aas_project/" there must be a Jar called P4_AAS.jar.
2. If everything ok: Launch Kathara inside folder "kathara/": kathara lstart
3. All shells will deploy necessary software: NB. Switch1, Switch2, CNT1 and CNT2 Shells will execute in background necessary P4 software, so they won't display anything in each shell.
